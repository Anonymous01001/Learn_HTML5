        <h1>I love island!!!</h1>
        <p>Through reverse induction, the best strategy can be used to analyze the island. 
            For the island, we have to think about it, but we can't be obsessed. To sum up, 
            with these questions in mind, let's examine the island together. It would be a 
            great pity for mankind if we cannot fully understand the island. Then, it is not 
            difficult to find that the question is what criteria should be used to make a decision? 
            The appearance of the island has rewritten the meaning of life. Pascal once said that the 
            essence of life lies in movement, and tranquility is death. He has a reason for saying that. 
            Meng Ke once said that when the heavens will send great missions to people, they must first 
            suffer from their will, exhaust their muscles and bones, starve their skin and skin, empty their 
            bodies, and disturb their actions. cannot. This sentence almost explains the root of the problem.</p>
